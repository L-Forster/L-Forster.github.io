lead_text: "The game includes procedurally generated levels, character AI tracking, and a local score storage system with value validation. As part of the A-level specification, I created an exhaustive list of test cases and systematically tested every feature to ensure that all bugs are minimised. The documentation for this project is comprehensive and explains in detail the decisions I made and their possible limitations."
