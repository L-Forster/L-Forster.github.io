lead_text: "This project contains two main sections: 1. A simple mobile app programmed using BeeWare, which acts as a remote control for the msuic player. 2. A python program on Raspberry Pi which constantly scans for oncoming traffic from the phone matching the specified commands. The input is then parsed and the desired command is executed (pause, volume, next track). The songs are stored locally on the Pi."
