lead_text: "An autonomous Twitch steamer programmed in NodeJS using the OpenAI API. The name was inspired by Al-Khwarizmi, inventor of the algorithm. It scrapes messages from the Twitch chat and generates a response. It stores the memory of the generated conversation with a maximum length. The personality can be completely personalised to suit the user's desire."
