lead_text: "A collection of algorithms designed to choose the best move for Mr. X in Scotland Yard. Basic overview: 1. It uses Dijkstra's qlgorithm to calculate distances between every node. 2. Using a custom data type 'Monte Carlo Game State', it runs a Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm to generate a set of terminal game states. 3. Applies a scoring system to each move based on an implementation of a UCT algorithm and the win probability to score all the moves. 4. It chooses the best move that doesn't end in a loss in the next turn, or selects a special move if the best move's score is below a threshold."
